## Theme

- Opera GX adds features geared towards gamers on top of the regular Opera browser.  
- The browser allows users to limit network, CPU, and memory usage to preserve system resources.
-  It also adds integrations with other apps such as Twitch, Discord, Twitter, and Instagram. 
-  The browser also has a built-in page called the GX Corner, which collates gaming-related releases, deals, and news articles.

## Motivation



- Opera GX presents you with a lot of data to help identify potential performance problems, as well as the tools to fix them.
-  It's like having a task manager built into the browser itself, a feature that Chrome also has. 
- Clean junk browser files to speed your PC up. Prioritize battery life when gaming on a laptop.

## Future Improvements.
-  One of the major problem with this software is that it requires a very strict adherence to coding in order to properly operate and it will be solved in the March 2022 update.
-  Improvement in design will be done so that the extensions built into opera is easy to find.
-  Opera Gx gives so many choices to the users regarding the internet usage and sometimes it can be confusing so we are looking forward to remove the least relevent ones.
